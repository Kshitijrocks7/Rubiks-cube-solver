# Rubiks-cube-solver

ðŸ§© A 3D virtual Rubikâ€™s Cube solver built with Python & VPython â€” scramble, visualize, and solve using Kociembaâ€™s algorithm. **Shortlisted for AeroHack 2025 Face Off Round.**

## Overview
This project simulates a 3Ã—3 Rubikâ€™s Cube in 3D (VPython) and solves any valid scrambled state using the Kociemba two-phase algorithm. It includes interactive controls, scramble and solve functionality, and animated moves for clear visualization.

## Features
- 3D visualization using **VPython**
- Integration with **kociemba** solver for near-optimal solutions
- Random scramble and step-by-step animated solve
- Manual rotation controls and demo-ready UI
- Delivered as submission for **AeroHack 2025** â€” shortlisted for Face Off
